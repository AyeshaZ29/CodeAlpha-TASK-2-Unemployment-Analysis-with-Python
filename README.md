***Project Overview***

This project analyzes unemployment rate trends in India using Python. It focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and understanding the impact of Covid-19 on employment. The goal is to extract insights that can help inform economic and social policy decisions.

This project was completed as Task 2 for the CODEALPHA Data Science Internship.

*Objectives*

Analyze unemployment rate data (percentage of unemployed people)

Clean and preprocess real-world data

Visualize unemployment trends over time

Study the impact of Covid-19 on unemployment rates

Identify seasonal and monthly patterns

Compare Rural vs Urban unemployment

Present insights useful for policymakers and researchers

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning & analysis

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Google Colab 

📂 Dataset

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india

Key Columns:

Date

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)

Area (Rural / Urban)

🔧 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported dataset using Pandas

Checked structure and data types

2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed extra spaces from column names

Dropped missing values

Converted Date column to datetime format

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical summary of unemployment rates

Trend analysis over time

Aggregated national unemployment average

4️⃣ Data Visualization

📈 Unemployment rate trend over time

📊 Monthly unemployment trend (seasonality)

🏙️ Rural vs Urban unemployment comparison

5️⃣ Covid-19 Impact Analysis

Compared unemployment rates:

Pre-Covid: Before March 2020

During Covid: March 2020 – June 2021

Calculated average unemployment rates for both periods

📊 Key Insights

Before Covid-19, unemployment remained relatively stable (≈ 9–10%)

During Covid-19, unemployment rates increased sharply

Average unemployment rate nearly doubled during the pandemic

Urban areas were more severely affected than rural areas

Seasonal patterns exist but were disrupted by Covid-19

Recovery after lockdowns was gradual and uneven

Conclusion

The Covid-19 pandemic caused a major disruption in India’s labor market, overriding normal seasonal employment trends. The findings highlight the importance of:

Employment support programs

Social protection policies

Skill development initiatives

Crisis preparedness for future economic shocks
